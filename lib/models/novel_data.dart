        '''In the small country of Ciel-Terra, the Royal Prince staged a coup d’etat, killed his own brother, the former King and took control of the throne with the backing of the Four Great Kingdoms.

On her 10th birthday, René was apprehended by the knights of the Royal Prince faction for being a cursed child with silver hair and silver eyes and learnt that she was the abandoned Princess of the country. And so, branded as one who ‘was related to the depraved once-king’, she was put through hellish torture before being executed via guillotine.

As her head parted from her body, René remembered.

That, she once already lived life as a man by the name of Nagajiro Satou on Earth, and, falling victim to this world’s God flattery, was forcibly reincarnated.

And whilst in such a state, a woman who called herself an evil goddess appeared before her.

“Do you not detest him? The God who only kept half his word and reincarnated you in this form?”

“Do you not detest them? The people who pushed you to your death for their own convenience?”

“If you wish for vengeance, I shall bless you with a special Divine Protection.”

Thus René, in the name of revenge, rose as the strongest and most fearsome undead. Named Monster: Rose Princess of Hellrage. And eventually, she will end the world…''',

        '''Yamada Kenichi is a 35 year old salaryman. Although he’s habitually absorbed in speedrunning through games, he had been lamenting over the current trend of ‘nuregames’* (ヌレゲー）.

And as such, he was captivated by a site with the catchphrase “For you, who likes to speedrun through games” and ended up reincarnating in the world of Hellmode. 


 
This is a story about summoned warrior, Allen, and his road to kingship.

As Allen reincarnated as a serf, he knew nothing of this world. 

Allen’s story will begin with absolutely no knowledge of the world at all, just like those games he had played 10, 20 years ago. 

TL Note: Nuregames (ヌレゲー) are games which are too simple and easily completed. The games which don’t really leave you with a sense of accomplishment once you have finished them.''',

So after desperately searching for a way to change this Job, I decided to look for the Divine Job Tome.

But the words I heard after changing professions were…

――You are now a Monster Tamer.

Thus, I became the world’s only Monster Tamer, with a skill to make a variety of monsters into my companions. In the first place, there were no monsters that me, a former “Hero”, couldn’t defeat. So slowly, a big army of monsters started to be built. But wait! I’m a Monster Tamer followed by monsters. I just want to befriend monsters, I don’t want to be thought to be the Demon King just because monsters are following me!''',

“……? No. After all, it doesn’t hurt Krische.”

Although gifted with the talent to do anything with ease, the girl lacked empathy.

In society, there is only loss and profit. No goodwill, no love.

Inhumanly recognizing cold, mathematical logic as everything, she looks at everything in the world through calculating lens.

Return given profit with profit, loss with loss.

The girl was undoubtedly pure, yet undeniably abnormal—

Her favorite things are cooking, food, and being pampered.

Her specialty is murder.

—- This is the story of a slightly unhinged girl being surrounded by kind and loving people, and her journey to find happiness.''',

    synopsis: '''“Hey there! I’m a Dark God! Not a bad one though, I swear!”

So quipped the dark god (or so he called himself) before he sent my classmates and me away into another world, following our deaths in an accident that no one could have seen coming.

And what a swell guy he was, creating new skills at our behest and offering us all kinds of support. How is he a dark god again?

…There definitely used to be a time when I thought that way, at least.

We should have been more careful. There are probably dozens of my classmates who thought they were getting their hands on a real cheat skill, something that would make them invincible, but now they have to deal with some rather unfortunate repercussions. I mean, he was pretty clear right from the start that we wouldn’t be getting any actual cheat skills.

I suppose they might just be reaping what they sow, in the end.

Oh, me? Well, I’m joining up with a couple of friends. We’ve known each other since we were kids, and now we’re set on leading lives where we won’t have too much to worry about. This new world we’re in might feel like a game, but it’s really anything but.''',
